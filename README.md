## Considerations taken

- No env file needed. The apis used are public and no secrets were used in the project
- More info that was required shown. For the purpose of having enough content to show the responsive design
- Incremental Static Regeneration. The revalidate time was left at 60 seconds for all endpoints. Considering the coingecko docs mention a 1 to 5 minute update time for free tiers, that is enough
